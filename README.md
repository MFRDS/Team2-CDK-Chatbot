Welcome to the Memora Chatbot repository! This project is made by Team 2 CendekiAwan RevoU to demonstrate how we build an intelligent chatbot using AWS Architecture, featuring Streamlit and SQLite. The chatbot provides real-time responses and allows users to manage and retrieve past conversations. User can also choose how Memora would behave in three mode: Professional, Friendly, or Humorous. Uploading a file is available and users can ask anything about it to Memora.
